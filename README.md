## UX

### Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience for this quiz & the features they would want.

The target audience for 'Around the World' are:
- Children aged 8-12
- Children interested in geography
- Children that would like to improve their geographical knowledge

Features that they would need included:
- A fun & interactive quiz
- The ability to track their scores so they can see if they're improving
- Control over which questions they answer to allow for continent specific testing
- A page with fun and interesting facts to enhance their learning

It was imperative to me that this website was simple & easy to use to ensure that the users had an enjoyable experience; therefore each page has a limited amount of information, written in simple language. 

As children aren't always guaranteed to have mobile phones this website has been designed to work well on desktops & tablets as well, to ensure that no matter the device the user has a positive user experience.
