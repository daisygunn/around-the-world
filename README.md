This website has been produced to provide a platform for an Educational geography game for children aged 8-12, it offers questions in a quiz format to test their knowledge on capital cities, borders, oceans & continents. 

In addition to the home page this website also features the 'Play Game' page and a 'Rules' page. The player has the option of selecting a quiz on a specific continent - if they feel they need to test themselves in a more specific way; otherwise they can select the Whole World option which will give them questions to test their overall knowledge.

The business goals of the website are:

## UX

### Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience for this quiz & the features they would want.

The target audience for 'Around the World' are:
- Children aged 8-12
- Children interested in geography
- Children that would like to improve their geographical knowledge

Features that they would need included:
- A fun & interactive quiz
- The ability to track their scores so they can see if they're improving
- Control over which questions they answer to allow for continent specific testing

It was imperative to me that this website was simple & easy to use to ensure that the users had an enjoyable experience; therefore each page has a limited amount of information, written in simple language. 

As children aren't always guaranteed to have mobile phones this website has been designed to work well on desktops & tablets as well, to ensure that no matter the device the user has a positive user experience.
