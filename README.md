## UX

### Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience for this quiz & the features they would want.

The target audience for 'Around the World' are:
- Children aged 8-12
- Children interested in geography
- Children that would like to improve their geographical knowledge

Features that they would need included:
- A fun & interactive quiz
- The ability to track their high scores so they can see if they're improving
- Control over which questions they answer to allow for continent specific testing
<!-- - A page with fun and interesting facts to enhance their learning -->

It was imperative to me that this website was simple & easy to use to ensure that the users had an enjoyable experience; therefore each page has a limited amount of information, written in simple language. 

As children aren't always guaranteed to have mobile phones this website has been designed to work well on desktops & tablets as well, to ensure that no matter the device the user has a positive user experience.

### Scope
In order to acheive the desired user and business goals this website will include the following:
1. A landing page with:
- a H1 element
- animated globe image
- Navigation bar

2. Play game page:
- H1 element
- Navigation bar
- Start game button
- Type of quiz buttons
- Quiz questions
- Score tally
- Quit game button

3. Rules page:
- H1 element
- Navigation bar
- Quiz rules and instructions

<!-- 4. Fun Facts page:
- H1 element
- Navigation bar
- Animated text boxes for users to click in order to read the fun facts. -->

### Structure
This is a multi-page website to keep the amount of information on each page limited and easy to digest; the rules, game and high scores are all seperated so that the child using the website are able to find what they want easily.
Each page is designed with simplicity in mind, each with a navbar and a H1 element and then the desired content centered below; this simplicity will allow for users to feel comfortable using and navigating each page.
The quiz itself has a question, a text input and four answer buttons - this layout of this will be responsive so that it isn't too squashed when being viewed on a smaller screen. 

### Skeleton
[View wireframes here](.assets/documents/wiresframes.pdf) - please note the actual website differs slightly from these wireframes.

### Surface
I chose to use a graident background using blues and greens to resemble the colour of the globe, I wanted something simple so as not to detract from any of the content. 
On the landing page there is an animated globe which zooms in and out upon the mouse being scrolled, this ineractive element provides something fun for the user straight away.
For the continent specific quiz games there is an font-awesome icon of that continent on a globe, this is used to break up the text but also provides a visual reminder of what this continent looks like. 
Using google fonts I chose Yogomi and Pacifico, I felt that Yogomi had a child handwriting feel to it and this will be used for all the heading elements on the webssite. I paired this with Pacifico for the bigger pieces of text as this would be easier to read.
